# Plotly for DataScience

Repository with visualization examples using the Plotly library. This is a good library for interactive dashboards and works very well with Flask in Webapps.

Dash was made by Plotly's creators as a way to easily implement a web interface and create dashboards with Plotly without having to learn javascript, html and other web technologies.With Dash you don't make visualizations, you build an interface to display Plotly's visualizations. It uses Flask under the hood so it is specially compatible with other Flask apps. For more info refer to Dash's deployment reference.

The other option is to use streamlit to create a webapp and embeded plotly on it.
